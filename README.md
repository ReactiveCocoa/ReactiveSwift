## What is ReactiveSwift?
__ReactiveSwift__ offers composable, declarative and flexible primitives that are built around the grand concept of ___streams of values over time___.

These primitives can be used to uniformly represent common Cocoa and generic programming patterns that are fundamentally an act of observation, e.g. delegate pattern, callback closures, notifications, control actions, responder chain events, [futures/promises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) and [key-value observing](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/KeyValueObserving/KeyValueObserving.html) (KVO).

Because all of these different mechanisms can be represented in the _same_ way,
it’s easy to declaratively compose them together, with less spaghetti
code and state to bridge the gap.

## Getting Started

1. **[Core Reactive Primitives][]**

   An overview of the semantics and example use cases of the ReactiveSwift primitives, including [`Signal`][], [`SignalProducer`][], [`Property`][] and [`Action`][].

1. **[Basic Operators][]**

   An overview of the operators provided to compose and transform streams of values.
   
1. **[ReactiveCocoa][ReactiveCocoa]**

   Building on top of ReactiveSwift, **ReactiveCocoa** extends Cocoa platform frameworks with reactive bindings and extensions.

1. **[How does ReactiveSwift relate to RxSwift?][]**

   An overview of how ReactiveSwift differs from RxSwift for Swift idiomaticity.
   
## Examples

1. **Interactive Form UI**

     ReactiveSwift includes a [_UI Examples_ playground][], which demonstrates:
     * how to build an interactive form UI with bindings, properties and `Action`s, with a live view in action.
     * how to use reactive primitives to implement the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern, with the View Model being the source of truth for the View.

1. **[Online Searching][]**

## Advanced Topics

1. **[ReactiveCocoa][]**
   
   Bindings and reactive extensions for Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks are offered separately as ReactiveCocoa.

1. **[API Reference][]**

1. **[API Contracts][]**

   Contracts of the ReactiveSwift primitives, Best Practices with ReactiveSwift, and Guidelines on implementing custom operators.

1. **[Debugging Techniques][]**

## Installation

ReactiveSwift supports macOS 10.9+, iOS 8.0+, watchOS 2.0+, tvOS 9.0+ and Linux.

#### Carthage

If you use [Carthage][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
ReactiveSwift to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift" ~> 5.0
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, make sure you have added `ReactiveSwift.framework` to the "_Linked Frameworks and Libraries_" section of your target, and have included them in your Carthage framework copying build phase.

#### CocoaPods

If you use [CocoaPods][] to manage your dependencies, simply add
ReactiveSwift to your `Podfile`:

```
pod 'ReactiveSwift', '~> 5.0'
```

#### Swift Package Manager

If you use Swift Package Manager, simply add ReactiveSwift as a dependency
of your package in `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift.git", from: "5.0.0")
```

#### Git submodule

 1. Add the ReactiveSwift repository as a [submodule][] of your
    application’s repository.
 1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` from within the ReactiveCocoa folder.
 1. Drag and drop `ReactiveSwift.xcodeproj` into your application’s Xcode
    project or workspace.
 1. On the “General” tab of your application target’s settings, add
    `ReactiveSwift.framework` to the “Embedded Binaries” section.
 1. If your application target does not contain Swift code at all, you should also
    set the `EMBEDDED_CONTENT_CONTAINS_SWIFT` build setting to “Yes”.

## Playground

We also provide a great Playground, so you can get used to ReactiveCocoa's operators. In order to start using it:

 1. Clone the ReactiveSwift repository.
 1. Retrieve the project dependencies using one of the following terminal commands from the ReactiveSwift project root directory:
     - `git submodule update --init --recursive` **OR**, if you have [Carthage][] installed    
     - `carthage checkout`
 1. Open `ReactiveSwift.xcworkspace`
 1. Build `Result-Mac` scheme
 1. Build `ReactiveSwift-macOS` scheme
 1. Finally open the `ReactiveSwift.playground`
 1. Choose `View > Show Debug Area`

## Have a question?
If you need any help, please visit our [GitHub issues][] or [Stack Overflow][]. Feel free to file an issue if you do not manage to find any solution from the archives.

## Release Roadmap
**Current Stable Release:**<br />[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift.svg)](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/releases)

### Plan of Record
#### ABI stability release
ReactiveSwift is expected to declare library ABI stability when Swift rolls out resilence support. Until then, ReactiveSwift would incrementally adopt new language features that help move towards to goal. The ETA is Swift 5.
