# RxSwift to ReactiveSwift Cheatsheet
This is a Cheatsheet for [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) developers migrating to projects using [ReactiveSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift).

Inspired by the [RxSwift to Combine cheatsheet](https://github.com/CombineCommunity/rxswift-to-combine-cheatsheet)

## Core Components

| RxSwift                   | ReactiveSwift                   | Notes                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AnyObserver               | Signal.Observer                 | In practice, since there are no different Observer types, the AnyObserver concept is redundant in ReactiveSwift
| BehaviorRelay             | Property / MutableProperty      | Since `MutableProperty` can never have errors, we don't need a Relay specific version.
| BehaviorSubject           | Property / MutableProperty      |
| Completable               | Signal / SignalProducer         | A `Signal` or `SignalProducer` where `Value == Never` can only complete or emit an error event
| CompositeDisposable       | CompositeDisposable             |
| ConnectableObservableType | ❌                              |
| Disposable                | Disposable                      | In ReactiveSwift you rarely have to keep hold of Disposables or manage their lifetime manually, it's mostly automatic.
| DisposeBag                | CompositeDisposable             | The concepte of a DisposeBag is not really needed in ReactiveSwift, see above.
| Driver                    | ❌                              |
| Maybe                     | ❌                              | Trivial to create using `take(first: 1)`
| Observable                | Signal / SignalProducer         | Signal is a "hot" observable, and SignalProducer is a "cold" observable that will only emit values once a subscription is started
| Observer                  | Signal.Observer                 |
| PublishRelay              | ❌                              | Could be recreated easily in ReactiveSwift using the `flatMapError` operator on a Signal.pipe()
| PublishSubject            | Signal.pipe()                   | There is no Subject type, but `Signal.pipe()` returns a tuple of `(output: Signal, input: Signal.Observer)` which you use to both observe and send values
| ReplaySubject             | ❌                              | Can be created using the `replayLazily(upTo:)` operator
| ScheduledDisposable       | ❌                              |
| SchedulerType             | Scheduler                       |
| SerialDisposable          | SerialDisposable                |
| Signal                    | ❌                              | Not to be confused with ReactiveSwift `Signal` which is completely different
| Single                    | ❌                              | Could easily be created as an initializer for `SignalProducer`
| SubjectType               | Signal.pipe()                   | There is no Subject type, but `Signal.pipe()` returns a tuple of `(output: Signal, input: Signal.Observer)` which you use to both observe and send values
| TestScheduler             | TestScheduler                   |
