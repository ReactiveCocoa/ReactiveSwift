## Signal

A **signal**, represented by the [`Signal`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/blob/master/ReactiveSwift/Signal.swift) type, is any series of [`Event`](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/blob/master/ReactiveSwift/Event.swift) values
over time that can be observed.

Signals are generally used to represent event streams that are already ‚Äúin progress‚Äù,
like notifications, user input, etc. As work is performed or data is received,
events are _sent_ on the signal, which pushes them out to any observers.
All observers see the events at the same time.

Users must observe a signal in order to access its events.
Observing a signal does not trigger any side effects. In other words,
signals are entirely producer-driven and push-based, and consumers (observers)
cannot have any effect on their lifetime. While observing a signal, the user
can only evaluate the events in the same order as they are sent on the signal. There
is no random access to values of a signal.

Signals can be manipulated by applying [primitives](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/blob/master/Documentation/BasicOperators.md) to them.
Typical primitives to manipulate a single signal like `filter`, `map` and
`reduce` are available, as well as primitives to manipulate multiple signals
at once (`zip`). Primitives operate only on the `value` events of a signal.

The lifetime of a signal consists of any number of `value` events, followed by
one terminating event, which may be any one of `failed`, `completed`, or
`interrupted` (but not a combination).
Terminating events are not included in the signal‚Äôs values‚Äîthey must be
handled specially.

### `Subscription`
A Signal represents and event stream that is already "in progress", sometimes also called "hot". This means, that a subscriber may miss events that have been sent before the subscription.
Furthermore, the subscription to a signal does not trigger any side effects

### `uniqueValues`
Forwards only those values from `self` that are unique across the set of
